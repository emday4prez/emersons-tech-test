# Emerson's Technical Test

Welcome to your technical test. You will be able to see a few files already setup for you on this project.
This test comes with a button component + a fully functional test for that component using jest & react testing library.

## Rules

- You may use any css framework: css, scss, tailwindcss, JSS etc
- You may use any state management system: Redux, context etc
- You may add typescript or convert the project to NextJS (or both).
- You can **NOT** use `someComp.jsx` naming conventions for components (look @ the existing code layout).
- Every page **MUST** have responsive design.

## Time

You may have as much time as you wish to complete the following task. Take your time and make sure to do everything right.

## Brief

You are hired to create a `Login`, `Registration` and `dashboard` page by a company.
Your application needs to be able to register new users, log in existing users and display them with a dashboard analytics page: https://dribbble.com/shots/20780228-LOOP-Sales-Dashboard-Animation
It doesn't need to be an exact replica of the above design but it needs the following stats:

- Total revenue $
- Total sales $
- Total new customers
- Total growth %
- Revenue graph
- Top Selling products
  and anything else you can think of adding this page.

You will also need to fill in the dashboard's dummy navigation bar, complete with a notifications modal.
When a customer registers you are required to have their information stored in state and redirected to the dashboard.
You will be required to have 1 hardcoded login email & password.
You will be required to have a log-out button which clears state and redirects you to the login page.
